Barbara

Remember, Barbara
It was raining without stop in Brest that day
And you were walking along smiling
Blooming enchanted dripping
Under the rain
Remember, Barbara
It was raining without stop in Brest
And I crossed your path on Siam Street
You smiled
And I smiled too
Remember, Barbara
You whom I didn't know
You who didn't know me
Remember
Remember in any case that day
Don't forget
A man was sheltering under a porch
And he cried out your name
Barbara
And you ran towards him in the rain
Dripping enchanted blooming
And you threw yourself in his arms
Remember that, Barbara
And forgive me if I say thou
I say thou to all those I love
Even if I've only seen them one single time
I say thou to all those who love
Even if I don't know them
Remember, Barbara
Don't forget
That rain wise and happy
On your happy face
On that happy town
That rain on the sea
On the Arsenal
On the boat to Ouessant
Oh, Barbara
War is such stupidity
What has become of you now
Under that rain of iron
Of fire steel and blood
And he who held you in his arms
Lovingly
Is he dead missing or perhaps still living
Oh, Barbara
It's raining without stop in Brest
Like it rained before
But it's not the same and everything is ruined
It's a terrible and desolate rain of mourning
It's no longer even the storm
Of iron steel and blood
Just simply clouds
That die like dogs
Dogs that disappear
Gradually over Brest
And go to rot in the distance
Far far away from Brest
Of which there's nothing left.
