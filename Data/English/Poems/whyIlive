Why Do I Live

Why do I live
Why do I live
For the yellow leg
Of a blonde
Leaning on the wall
In full sunlight
For the round sail
Of a boat in the port
For the shadow of the awnings
The iced coffee
That you drink in a tube
To touch the sand
See through the water
That becomes so blue
That goes down so far
With the fish
The calm fish
That graze on the bottom
Fly over
The hairy algae
Like slow little birds
Like blue little birds
Why do I live
Because itâ€™s lovely.
